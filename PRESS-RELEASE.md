# CS Visualized #

## A helpful resource for visualizing data structures for programmers.


### Summary
One of the keys to writing better code is a solid understanding of how common data structures work and when to use them. Memorizing a definition or an implementation is insufficient. But with the help of clear visualizations and gradually more difficult interactive features, the student truly learns the paradigm and can apply it naturally when needed.


### The Problem with Other Resources
There are many resources for reading about computer science concepts on the web, but data structures and algorithms require a more interactive approach. The interactive resources that are available are often not user friendly, or aimed to high or low to have broad appeal to programmers.


### The CS Visualized Approach
Some people quickly pick up abstract concepts without examples, but for the rest of us there's nothing more helpful than seeing how the idea is represented in real life. Colorful, interactive visualizations pull the student in, allowing them to discover for themselves how the structure or algorithm can benefit them.
